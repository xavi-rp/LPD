	Abstract = {Aim: The present study models the response of vegetation to drought between 1982 and 2011 focusing on the growing season, considering: (1) vulnerable versus resistant ecosystems, (2) ecosystem resilience, (3) the delayed response of vegetation to accumulated precipitation deficits and (4) reduction in productivity due to drought. Location: Continental Europe. Methods: Vegetation condition was analysed by anomalies of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation ({FAPAR}) within the growing season. {FAPAR} was modelled as a function of: (1) monthly deviation from long-term average drought conditions, (2) past monthly deviation from long-term average drought conditions, and (3) past monthly deviation from long-term average {FAPAR} conditions. Significant regression coefficients were mapped as ecosystem resistance as well as ecosystem resilience to drought. Annual and long-term growing season productivity were assessed over ecosystems vulnerable to drought within diverse biomes and plant functional types and were studied together with the extent, timing, frequency, duration and intensity of drought events. Results: Mediterranean ecosystems showed the least resistance to drought but were resilient. Steppic ecosystems showed weak resistance and also weak resilience. Results also indicated weak resistance against drought of the Atlantic and Continental regions with various recovery rates. Productivity decline was observed when the timing, intensity, frequency and extent of drought events targeted the growing season of the vegetation cover. Main conclusions: This study presents an improved method for modelling the impact of drought on the productivity of vegetation by considering the timing, intensity, duration and location of drought events within the growing season, and maps and analyses the resistance and resilience of plant functional types and biomes. {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	Abstract = {Observed alternation of global and local meteorological patterns governs increasing drought impact, which puts at risk ecological balance and biodiversity of the alpine forest. Despite considerable attention, drought impact on forest ecosystems is still not entirely understood, and comprehensive forest drought monitoring has not been implemented. In this study, we proposed to bridge this gap exploiting a time-domain synergetic use of medium resolution {MODSI} {NDVI} (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and {NDII}7 (Normalized Difference Infrared Index band 7) time series as well as on-station temperature and precipitation measures combined in the {scPDSI} (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index) datasets. Analysis employed the S-mode Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) examined under multiple method settings and data setups. The investigation performed for South Tyrol (2001-2012) indicated prolonged meteorological drought condition between 2003 and 2007, as well as general drying tendencies. Corresponding temporal variability was identified for local mountain forest. The former response was fostered more often by {NDII}7, which is related to foliage water content, whereas {NDVI} was more prone to report on an overall downturn and implied drop in forest photosynthetic activity. Among tested approaches, the covariance-matrix based S-mode {PCA} of z-score normalized vegetation season {NDVI} and {NDII}7 time series ensured the most prominent identification of drought impact. Consistency in recognized temporal patterns confirms integrity of the approach and aptness of used remote-sensed datasets, suggesting great potential for drought oriented environmental analyses. {\copyright} 2016 by the authors.},

	Abstract = {Drought affects more people than any other natural disaster but there is little understanding of how ecosystems react to droughts. This study jointly analyzed spatio-temporal changes of drought patterns with vegetation phenology and productivity changes between 1999 and 2010 in major European bioclimatic zones. The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index ({SPEI}) was used as drought indicator whereas changes in growing season length and vegetation productivity were assessed using remote sensing time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}). Drought spatio-temporal variability was analyzed using a Principal Component Analysis, leading to the identification of four major drought events between 1999 and 2010 in Europe. Correspondence Analysis showed that at the continental scale the productivity and phenology reacted differently to the identified drought events depending on ecosystem and land cover. Northern and Mediterranean ecosystems proved to be more resilient to droughts in terms of vegetation phenology and productivity developments. Western Atlantic regions and Eastern Europe showed strong agglomerations of decreased productivity and shorter vegetation growing season length, indicating that these ecosystems did not buffer the effects of drought well. In a climate change perspective, increase in drought frequency or intensity may result in larger impacts over these ecosystems, thus management and adaptation strategies should be strengthened in these areas of concerns. {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Soil salinity is a global issue and one of the major causes of land degradation. The large scale monitoring of salt-affected areas is therefore very important to shed light on necessary rehabilitation measures and to avoid further land degradation. We address the productivity limitation of salt-affected soils across the European continent by the usage of soil maps and high temporal resolution time series of satellite images derived from the {SPOT} vegetation sensor. Using the yearly dynamism of the vegetation signal derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, we decomposed the spectral curve into its base fraction and seasonal dynamism fractions next to an index approximating gross primary productivity. We observe gross primary productivity, base fraction and seasonal dynamism productivity differences of saline, sodic and not salt-affected soils under croplands and grasslands in four major climatic zones of the European continent. Analysis of variance models and post hoc tests of mean productivity values indicate significant productivity differences between the observed salt-affected and salt free areas, between management levels of soils as well as between the saline and sodic character of the land. The analysis gives insight into the limiting effect of climate in relation to the productivity of salt-affected soils. The proposed indicators are applicable on the global level, are objective and readily repeatable with yearly updates, thus, might contribute to the global operational monitoring and assessment of degraded lands. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The present study classified global Ecosystem Functional Types ({EFTs}) derived from seasonal vegetation dynamics of the {GIMMS}3g {NDVI} time-series. Rotated Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) was run on the derived phenological and productivity variables, which selected the Standing Biomass (approximation of Net Primary Productivity), the Cyclic Fraction (seasonal vegetation productivity), the Permanent Fraction (permanent surface vegetation), the Maximum Day (day of maximum vegetation development) and the Season Length (length of vegetation growing season) variables, describing 98\% of the variation in global ecosystems. {EFTs} were created based on Isodata classification of the spatial patterns of the Principal Components and were interpreted via gradient analysis using the selected remote sensing variables and climatic constraints (radiation, temperature, and water) of vegetation growth. The association of the {EFTs} with existing climate and land cover classifications was demonstrated via Detrended Correspondence Analysis ({DCA}). The ordination indicated good description of the global environmental gradient by the {EFTs}, supporting the understanding of phenological and productivity dynamics of global ecosystems. Climatic constraints of vegetation growth explained 50\% of variation in the phenological data along the {EFTs} showing that part of the variation in the global phenological gradient is not climate related but is unique to the Earth Observation derived variables. {DCA} demonstrated good correspondence of the {EFTs} to global climate and also to land use classification. The results show the great potential of Earth Observation derived parameters for the quantification of ecosystem functional dynamics and for providing reference status information for future assessments of ecosystem changes. {\copyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee {MDPI}, Basel, Switzerland.},

	Abstract = {The present study demonstrates remote sensing derived phenological and productivity indicators of ecosystem functional dynamism. The indices were derived from {SPOT} {VEGETATION} {NDVI} data on 1 km spatial resolution across the pan-European continent using the Phenolo approach. The phenological and productivity indices explained 78\% of the variance in the European ecosystem gradient measured by bio-climatic zones. Along this gradient climatic predictors could only explain 57\% of the variance in the satellite metrics. Reclassification of the bio-climatic zones into phenology and productivity related ecosystem functional units ({EFUs}) selected five metrics related to the cyclic and permanent fraction of productivity, to the background, to the growing season start and the timing of the maximum {NDVI} value. Along the {EFU} gradient the climatic predictors explained over 90\% of the variance of the remote sensing variables, 30\% more than along the bio-climatic gradient. The {EFUs} showed strong correspondence to 14 land-cover types in Europe and the selected remote sensing metrics explained 86\% of the variation in the land-cover classes. These results show that remote sensing derived parameters have tremendous potential for the quantification of ecosystem functional dynamism. Phenological and productivity metrics offer an indicator system for ecosystems that climatic indicators alone cannot manifest. Their potential to monitor the spatial pattern, status and inter-annual variability of ecosystems and vegetation cover can deliver reference status information for future assessments of the impacts of human or climate change induced ecosystem changes. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{ivits_addressing_2013,
	Abstract = {Earth observation based monitoring of change in vegetation phenology and productivity is an important and widely used approach to quantify degradation of ecosystems due to climatic or human influences. Most satellite based studies apply linear or polynomial regression methods for trend detections. In this paper it is argued that natural systems hardly react to human or natural influences in a linear or a polynomial manner. At shorter time-scales of few decades natural systems fluctuate to a certain extent in a non-systematic manner without necessarily changing equilibrium. Finding a systematic model that describes this behavior on large spatial scales is certainly a difficult challenge. Furthermore, the manner vegetation phenology reacts to climate and to socio-economic changes is also dependent on the land cover type and on the bioclimatic region. In addition to this, traditional parametric methods require the fulfillment of several statistical criteria. In case these criteria are violated confidence intervals and significance tests of the models may be biased, even misleading. This paper proposes an alternative approach termed the Steadiness to traditional trend analysis methods. Steadiness combines the direction or tendency of the change and the net change of the time-series over a selected time period. It is a non-parametric approach which can be used without violation of statistical criteria, it can be applied on short time-series as well and results are not dependent on the significance test or on thresholds. To demonstrate differences, a time-series of satellite derived Season Length images for 24 years is analyzed for the entire European continent using linear regression and the Steadiness approach. Spatial and temporal change patterns and sensitivity to pre-processing algorithms are compared between the two methods. We show that linear regression limits the possibilities of assessing fluctuating ecosystem changes whereas the non-parametric Steadiness index more consistently confirms the fluctuating phenological change patterns. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The projected influence of climate change on the timing and volume of phytomass production is expected to affect a number of ecosystem services. In order to develop coherent and locally effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, spatially explicit information on the observed changes is needed. Long-term variations of the vegetative growing season in different environmental zones of Europe for 1982-2006 have been derived by analysing time series of {GIMMS} {NDVI} data. The associations of phenologically homogenous spatial clusters to time series of temperature and precipitation data were evaluated. North-east Europe showed a trend to an earlier and longer growing season, particularly in the northern Baltic areas. Despite the earlier greening up large areas of Europe exhibited rather stable season length indicating the shift of the entire growing season to an earlier period. The northern Mediterranean displayed a growing season shift towards later dates while some agglomerations of earlier and shorter growing season were also seen. The correlation of phenological time series with climate data shows a cause-and-effect relationship over the semi natural areas consistent with results in literature. Managed ecosystems however appear to have heterogeneous change pattern with less or no correlation to climatic trends. Over these areas climatic trends seemed to overlap in a complex manner with more pronounced effects of local biophysical conditions and/or land management practices. Our results underline the importance of satellite derived phenological observations to explain local nonconformities to climatic trends for climate change impact assessment. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme ({PECBM}) has been launched by the {BirdLife} Partnership in Europe, where the European Bird Census Council has been collecting data from 20 independent breeding bird survey programs across Europe over the last 25 years. These data show dramatic declines in European farmland birds. We suggest that seasonal characteristics of vegetation cover derived from high temporal resolution remote sensing images could facilitate the monitoring the suitability of farmland bird habitats, and that these indicators may be a better choice for monitoring than climate data. We used redundancy analysis to link the {PECBM} data of the estimated number of farmland birds in Europe to a set of phenological and climatic indicators and to the biogeographic regions of Europe. Variance partitioning was used to account for the variation explained by the phenological and climate variables and by the area of the environmental strata individually, to define the pure effect of the variables, and to extract the total explained variance. The analysis revealed high statistical significance (p {\textless} 0. 001) of the correlations between species and environment. Phenological indices explained 38\% of the variance in community composition of the 23 farmland bird species, whereas climate explained 30\% of the variance. After partitioning the other variables as covariables, the pure effect of phenology, climate, and environmental strata were 16\%, 8\%, and 16\%, respectively. Based on the probability results, we suggest that phenological indicators derived from remote sensing may supply better indicators for continental scale biodiversity studies than climate only. In addition, these indicators are cost and time effective, are on continuous scale, and are readily repeatable on a large spatial coverage while supplying standardized results. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	Abstract = {Land degradation is the reduction of the capacity of land to sustain its ecosystem functions and services that support society and development. In this study we derive phenological indices from time series of Spot {VEGETATON} images. For the African continent, we illustrate that such metrics show observable trends that can help explaining the state and evolution of vegetative land cover due to climatic and/or anthropogenic influences and can be considered a largescale proxy adding to assessment of land degradation.},

@article{ivits_estimating_2009,
	Abstract = {Following the European Commission's Water Framework Directive all surface waters in {EU}'s Member States must reach a good status by 2015. The evaluation of this status will be partly based on ecological criteria, such as the hydro-morphological quality criteria which also evaluate the structure and condition of the riparian zone. Riparian zones with undisturbed or nearly undisturbed condition are given high-ecological status. The agri-environmental measures in the {EU} promote an extensive use of land to protect the farmed environment and its biodiversity. Recent studies in Andalusia and elsewhere suggest that extensification leads to riparian zones with higher ecological status compared to intensively used areas. We suggest that extensification and thus better ecological status of the riparian zone can be partly approximated by the amount of vegetation permanently present on the area. For this the so-called permanent vegetation fraction was derived from a multi-temporal advanced very high-resolution radiometer ({AVHRR}) dataset and was used (1) to classify the ecological status of the riparian zone into two classes, favourable and unfavourable, and (2) to assess the effect of agricultural practices on these areas. The classification was validated by field observations in the Guadalquivir river basin while detailed information on farming practices helped to assess the effect of agriculture on the riparian zone. The assessment was carried out in olive land cover because erosion control in olive cultivations is the most widely implemented measure in Andalusia. Results suggest that the remotely sensed permanent vegetation fraction is a good indicator of the favourable and unfavourable ecological status of the riparian zone. Furthermore, extensification of agricultural practices expressed in terms of increasing permanent vegetation cover was shown to have positive effect on the riparian zone as opposed to areas where no measures were implemented. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
